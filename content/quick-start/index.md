How to start a new Hyas project — one pager.

## Requirements

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/) — latest source release
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) — latest LTS version or newer

## Get started

Start a new Hyas project in three steps:

### 1. Create a new site

```bash
git clone https://github.com/h-enk/hyas.git my-hyas-site && cd my-hyas-site
```

### 2. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Start development server

```bash
npm run start
```

Hyas will start the Hugo development webserver accessible by default at `http://localhost:1313`. Saved changes will live reload in the browser.
